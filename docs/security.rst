Security
========

OAuth 2 Authentication and Authorization
----------------------------------------

Connexion supports one of the three OAuth 2 handling methods. (See
"TODO" below.) With Connexion, the API security definition **must**
include a 'x-tokenInfoUrl' or 'x-tokenInfoFunc (or set ``TOKENINFO_URL``
or ``TOKENINFO_FUNC`` env var respectively). 'x-tokenInfoUrl' must contain an
URL to validate and get the `token information`_ and 'x-tokenInfoFunc must
contain a reference to a function used to obtain the token info. When both 'x-tokenInfoUrl'
and 'x-tokenInfoFunc' are used, Connexion will prioritize the function method. Connexion expects to
receive the OAuth token in the ``Authorization`` header field in the
format described in `RFC 6750 <rfc6750_>`_ section 2.1. This aspect
represents a significant difference from the usual OAuth flow.

The ``uid`` property (username) of the Token Info response will be passed in the ``user`` argument to the handler function.

You can find a `minimal OAuth example application`_ in Connexion's "examples" folder.

HTTPS Support
-------------

When specifying HTTPS as the scheme in the API YAML file, all the URIs
in the served Swagger UI are HTTPS endpoints. The problem: The default
server that runs is a "normal" HTTP server. This means that the
Swagger UI cannot be used to play with the API. What is the correct
way to start a HTTPS server when using Connexion?
