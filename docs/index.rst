    If you are upgrading from Connexion 2, refer to the :doc:`v3` section.

Welcome to Connexion's documentation!
=====================================

Connexion is a modern Python web framework that makes spec-first and api-first development easy. You
describe your API in an `OpenAPI`_ (or swagger) specification with as much detail as you want and
Connexion will guarantee that it works as you specified.

Connexion Features
------------------

Based on your specification, Connexion provides the following functionality:

* Automatic routing to your Python functions
* Authentication
* Request validation
* Parameter parsing and injection
* Response serialization
* Response validation
* A Swagger UI console with live documentation and 'try it out' feature

Connexion also helps you write your OpenAPI specification and develop against it by providing a
command line interface which lets you test and mock your specification.

.. code-block:: bash

    connexion run openapi.yaml

Why Connexion?
--------------

Being spec-first is what makes Connexion unique in the Python ecosystem. With Connexion, you write
your API specification first, and automatically get a lot of functionality. With all other popular
Python web frameworks, you write your functionality first, and automatically get your specification.

We choose the spec-first approach because it:

* Stimulates thinking about the design of your API and enables quick feedback loops
* Creates a common understanding of how the API should work
* Allows server and client development in parallel
* Enables contract testing
* Allows for orchestrating multiple layers of your API stack from one contract (eg. API Gateway)

For a more detailed explanation about the benefits of working spec-first, or an overview of helpful
tooling, have a look at our `recommended resources`_.
