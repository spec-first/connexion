Connexion 3.0: API-first for all
================================

**We are excited to announce the release of Connexion 3.0!** 🎉

Connexion 3 fundamentally changes how Connexion is designed and implemented, and how it
fits into the wider Python API ecosystem. We adopted the ASGI interface, which makes Connexion both
modular and well-integrated with most modern Python API tooling.

**It brings some major changes compared to 2.X:**

* The improved ``App`` and new ``AsyncApp`` allow you to use Connexion as a stand-alone framework

  * The ``App`` interface was extended so you no longer have to care about the framework used
    underneath

* Connexion can now be used as middleware to supercharge any ASGI or WSGI-compatible framework
  with its spec-based functionality
* Connexion is now pluggable in many dimensions:

  * All Connexion functionality is pluggable by adding or removing middleware from its stack
  * Validation is now pluggable by content type, solving longstanding issues regarding endpoints
    with multiple content types and making it easy to add validation for additional content types
  * Authentication is now pluggable by security scheme, making it easy to customize the behavior or
    add support for additional security schemes.

* Aiohttp support has been dropped due to lack of ASGI support
* We spent a lot of effort on extending and improving `our documentation`_

**Read on below to discover more changes.** 👇

Getting started with Connexion 3
--------------------------------

Using stand-alone Connexion
---------------------------

You can use Connexion as a stand-alone web framework, using one of the available apps:

* The ``App`` (alias ``FlaskApp``), which is built on top of Flask as known from Connexion 2.X.
* The ``AsyncApp``, which is built on top of starlette and provides native asynchronous functionality.

If you don't require compatibility with the Flask ecosystem, we recommend to use the ``AsyncApp``.
Even when writing mostly synchronous code, as you can just use synchronous view functions.

Using Connexion with ASGI or WSGI frameworks
--------------------------------------------

If you want to leverage Connexion functionality with third party ASGI frameworks, you can use the
``ConnexionMiddleware`` and wrap it around a third party application.

This provides all Connexion functionality except for automatic routing, automatic parameter injection,
and response serialization. You can add some of this functionality using ``Decorators`` provided by
Connexion:

* ``FlaskDecorator``: provides automatic parameter injection and response serialization for Flask
  applications.
* ``ASGIDecorator``: provides automatic parameter injection for ASGI applications. Note that this
  decorator injects Starlette datastructures (such as ``UploadFile``).
* ``StarletteDecorator``: provides automatic parameter injection and response serialization for
  Starlette applications.

For examples, see https://github.com/spec-first/connexion/tree/main/examples/frameworks.

Pluggable validation by content type
------------------------------------

Validation is now pluggable by content type, which means that the `VALIDATOR_MAP` has been updated
to accommodate this.

You can use the ``connexion.datastructures.MediaTypeDict`` to support content type ranges.

.. code-block:: python

    VALIDATOR_MAP = {
        "parameter": ParameterValidator,
        "body": MediaTypeDict(
            {
                "*/*json": JSONRequestBodyValidator,
                "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": FormDataValidator,
                "multipart/form-data": MultiPartFormDataValidator,
            }
        ),
        "response": MediaTypeDict(
            {
                "*/*json": JSONResponseBodyValidator,
                "text/plain": TextResponseBodyValidator,
            }
        ),
    }

You can pass it either to the app, or when registering an API.

.. code-block:: python

    app = connexion.App(__name__, validator_map=VALIDATOR_MAP)
    app.add_api("openapi.yaml", validator_map=VALIDATOR_MAP)

An ``AbstractRequestBodyValidator`` and ``AbstractResponseBodyValidator`` class are available to
support the creation of custom validators.

ASGI Server
-----------

Connexion 3.0 needs to be run using an ASGI server instead of a WSGI server. While any ASGI server
should work, connexion comes with ``uvicorn`` as an extra:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install connexion[uvicorn]

Check :ref:`quickstart:Running your application` for more details on how to run your application
using an ASGI server.

.. warning::

    You can wrap Connexion with the `ASGIMiddleware`_ offered by `a2wsgi`_ to run it with a WSGI
    server. You will however lose the benefits offered by ASGI, and performance might be
    impacted. You should only use this as a temporary workaround until you can switch to an ASGI
    server.

Smaller breaking changes
------------------------

* The ``options`` argument has been renamed to ``swagger_ui_options`` and now takes an instance
  of the :class:`.SwaggerUIOptions`. The naming of the options themselves have been changed to
  better represent their meaning.
* The ``uri_parser_class`` is now passed to the ``App`` or its ``add_api()`` method directly
  instead of via the ``options`` argument.
* The ``jsonifier`` is now passed to the ``App`` or its ``add_api()`` method instead of setting it
  as an attribute on the Api.
* Drop Flask 1.X support and support Flask 2.X async routes
* Drop Python 3.6 (and add Python 3.10) support
* ``connexion.request`` is now a Starlette ``Request`` instead of a Flask ``Request``
* Route priority changed. The most specific route should now be defined first in the specification.
* We no longer guess a content type for response serialization if multiple are defined in the spec.
  We do take into account returned headers.
* Don't return 400 when read-only property is received
* Content type is now validated for requests and responses if defined in the spec
* The deprecated positions for ``x-body-name`` are no longer supported
* The parameter ``pass_context_arg_name`` has been removed. Context is now available as global
  request-level context, or can be passed in by defining a ``context_`` parameter in your view function.
* The ``MethodViewResolver`` has been renamed to ``MethodResolver``, and a new ``MethodViewResolver``
  has been added to work with Flask's ``MethodView`` specifically.
* Built-in support for uWSGI has been removed. You can re-add this functionality using a custom middleware.
* The request body is now passed through for ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``CONNECT`` and ``OPTIONS`` methods as well.
* The signature of error handlers has changed and default Flask error handlers are now replaced
  with default Connexion error handlers which work the same for ``AsyncApp`` and
  ``ConnexionMiddleware``.


Non-breaking changes
--------------------

* Relative and nested refs are now supported in OpenAPI / Swagger specifications
* The ``required`` keyword is now supported for requestBodies
* HTTP exceptions are now implemented as a hierarchy
* Connexion now exposes ``context``, ``operation``, ``receive``, ``scope`` as global request-level context
* Connexion now provides a ``DefaultsJSONRequestBodyValidator`` to fill in default values in received
  request bodies.
